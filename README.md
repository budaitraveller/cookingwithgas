# Notes

Configured as per: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

# Issues

Can't view css locally due to: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/332
Have to work around that ourselves at some point

For now, run with:
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
