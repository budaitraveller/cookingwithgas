##Build

IN THE TOP DIRECTORY

bundle exec jekyll build

##Run

bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --baseurl=

##Push

Just push to gh-pages

Note that it usually takes a few minutes for the site to build when you push to github.

## Using categories

They don't really work the way you would like them to.  You have to add a category html file manually, and add the category to the nav menu manually.  Actually, looks like the whole category setup is pretty busted.  Need to fix it up.
