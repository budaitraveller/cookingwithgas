# Notes

Configured as per: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

This works pretty well. 

# Issues

Todo-issues are here: https://github.com/budaitraveller/cookingwithgas/issues

For now, run locally with:

bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''

That is due to: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/332
